# mock-iot-api

A collection of MakeCode and MicroPython blocks/code to play around with IoT concepts.

This is only an "empty" implementation of the API (i.e, functions do not do anything other than log their representative actions), that have been made to mock user code with a proposed IoT implementation.

In essence micro:bit nodes would communicate with a central micro:bit hub tethered to a computer or small SBC. 

This is just an initial proposal, so it is very open to suggestions and constructive criticism, and the final implementation could look completely different.
