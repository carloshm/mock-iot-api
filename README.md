# mock-iot-api

A collection of MakeCode blocks to play around with IoT concepts.

This is only an "empty" implementation of the blocks (i.e, they do not do anything other than log their representative actions), made to be able to mock example programs with a proposed API for what an IoT implementation might look like with the micro:bit.

This is just an initial proposal, so it is very open to suggestions and constructive criticism, and the final implementation could look completely different.
